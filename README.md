# Kata

I have recently been convinced of the necessity of continuing to practice software.
These challenges that I'm completing are an opportunity for me to remain familiar with my language, explore design patterns, practice refactoring and writing tests.
Challenges are being sourced from http://codekata.com/

Resources I am leaning heavily on are Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz, Design Patterns in Ruby by Russ Olsen and Metaprogramming Ruby 2 by Paolo Perrotta
