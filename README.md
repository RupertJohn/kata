# Kata

I have recently been convinced of the necessity of continuing to practice software.
These challenges that I'm completing are an opportunity for me to remain familiar with my language, explore design patterns, practice refactoring and writing tests.
Challenges are being sourced from http://codekata.com/ and from observing the world around me (courtesy of Noah Gibbs's thoughts on Conscious Coding Practice)

When creating a coding challenge I consider 4 things: Tool, Task, Purpose, Timebox.
The Tool is which language, framework, etc that I will be using.
The Task is what I will be coding.
The Purpose is the reason why I'm doing this practice. This could be practicing an architectural style, learning a tool, or any other purpose.
The Timebox is to make sure that I pull all the benefit I can from the practice. Either I will complete it or I won't. If I do then it shows that I used my time effectively, if not I am shown that I need to go faster or make simpler assumptions.

Resources I am leaning heavily on are Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz, Design Patterns in Ruby by Russ Olsen and Metaprogramming Ruby 2 by Paolo Perrotta
